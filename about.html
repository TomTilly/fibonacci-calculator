				<h2>What is the Fibonacci Sequence?</h2>
				<p>The Fibonacci sequence is an integer sequence in which the first and second numbers equal 1 and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The following is the start of the seqeuence:</p>

				<p>Above, you can see that the third term in the sequence, 2, is the sum of the first two terms (1+1). The fourth term, 3, is the sum of the previous two terms (1+2).</p>
				<p>The Fibonacci sequence is named after Fibonacci, who was the first to introduce the sequence to the western world.</p>
				<h2>The Fibonacci Sequence in Nature</h2>
				<p>The Fibonacci sequence is noteworthy because of it's prevalance in nature. For example, the arrangenments of leaves in a plant, the number of petals on a flower, or the curvature of a Nautilus shell all relate to the Fibonacci sequence. Not everything in nature contains the Fibonacci sequence, but it remains a widely seen phenomenom.</p>

				<h2>The Calculator</h2>
				<p>The calculator on this site will  calculate any of the first 999 terms in the Fibonacci sequence. Simply enter the term you want to find and the result will be displayed. Be sure to omit any contractions after the number you enter. For example, to find the 243rd term, enter 243 without the "rd".</p>
